# C++ basics

## Datatypes
1. Primitive: Built in datatypes or predefined and can be used directly by the user to declare variables
   1. Int - To store integer value and requires 4 bytes. -2147483648 to 2147483647.
   2. Char - For storing characters
   3. Float - For storing boolean or logical values
   4. Bool - For storing single precision floating point or decimal values
   5. Void - Void means without any value. Represents a valueless entity.
2. Abstract: Defined by the user.
   1. Class
   2. Structure

## Datatype modifier
Used with built-in datatype to modify the length of data that a particular datatype can hold. They are-
    1. Signed
    2. Unsigned
    3. Short
    4. Long

## Input/Output operations
1. iostream - iostream stands for standard input/output stream. This header file contains definition to objects like cin, cout, cerr,etc.
2. iomanip - iomanip stands for input output manipulators. The methods declared in this files are used for manipulating streams. This files contains definition of setw, setprecision, etc.
3. fstream - Mainly describes the file stream. This header file is used to handle the data being read from a file as input or data being written into the file as output.
